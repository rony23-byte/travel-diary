        <p style="font-size: 20px;">  To many people, Marrakech is what dreams are made of. This place has the potential to feel surreal, from its regal palaces to its tight, winding markets. Honestly, imagine this: snake charmers and fortune tellers in the main square, vendors selling leather and spices on narrow streets, colorful palaces imposing their will on the city in every direction, and camels and horse-drawn carriages slowly making their way through the streets. 

            Marrakech is in many ways a city of wonder, and I felt this way both times that I visited. There is just something special in this city that is hard to find in other corners of the world. This is what earned it a place on my list of the best cities to visit in 2022.
            
            Going to Morocco can really be a once in a lifetime kind of trip if you plan it the right way. There are some really incredible things to see and do, and normally all at a great price. The food is outstanding, the desert activities like camping and camelback riding are always a blast, and the history is just everywhere. Marrakech is always a great starting point for a Morocco trip because it is fairly central, very busy, and very tourist friendly. From here, Casablanca, Rabat, Fez, and all of the other major cities are very accessible by train. .
