            <h2>Importance of Tourism Industry!</h2>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                 .</p><br><br>Countries such as the US, France, and Spain fight over leadership in this sector with the aim of positioning themselves as the world's first tourist power, which to say the least, is a very profitable objective. The tourism industry not only generates revenues for a country and cultural wealth, but it is also one of the most important economic engines for growth and development.

                 Globalization, as well as diplomatic relations among countries, has made traveling increasingly common. That is, the percentage of the world population that requires an entry visa to visit foreign destinations decreased from 75%, in 1980, to 53%, in 2018. The result is that more and more people travel from one country to the other on a recurring basis, which has increased the frequency of leisure travel from 50 to 56%, according to a report of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).
                 
                 Tourism is a great source of income and employment for countries that receive more tourists, which has had a significant impact on the main economies of the world.
                 
                 For this reason, many countries have increased their investment in the tourism industry, including several campaigns and strategies to highlight the attractiveness of their main destinations. This current state of tourism has benefited all continents of the world, growing in the number of arrivals year after year. Tourism, in short, has become a fundamental pillar for the economic growth of all countries, accounting for a good portion of the worldâ€™s GDP. Despite the time, the tourism industry has not lost that dynamism that allowed it to grow exponentially over the years.
