        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> The current modern Watamu has a young history that can be traced from 1937 when an Irish family, the Flynns, wrecked around Watamu and were washed ashore on the current beach of Turtle Bay and where they lived in an upturned boat.
            Back then Watamu was just a forest without population, except for the occasional fishermen from Malindi and Lamu (Bagiuni people, Bajuni in Swahili, Bajuni people descended from intermarriages between Giriama and Arab traders) who occasionally swam to shore when the sea was rough took refuge in thatched huts in Northern previous Beach, near present-day position of  Watamu village. The current development began around 1950-1960, when the British colonial government drew 50 pitches on the beach starting to lottizzarle for most of the white settlers in Kenya and all international visitors interested. This gave Watamu its appeal as a holiday destination. Lots rank from where it is now Blue Bay to the mouth of Mida Creek.
            The indigenous people of Kenya were also included when the then government developed the system of settlement in Gede which covers the areas of Gede, Jimba, Dabaso and allowed the Mijikenda to buy land and settle.
            Even the families of fishermen Bajuni began settling in the village of Watamu when the British government blew up a small part of the cliff to provide the gateway (Mlango in Swahili) to craft so they could dock closer to the shore, while the village was still protected from the cliffs during or before the Second World War. This allowed Watamu to have a large garden of coral and abundant fish for this community given that fisheries is the main economic activity and a ready market for vacationers to these beaches.</p>
